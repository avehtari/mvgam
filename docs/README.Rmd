*mvgam*
================

The goal of `mvgam` is to use a Bayesian framework to estimate parameters of Generalised Additive Models for discrete time series with dynamic trend components. 
  
## Installation
Install the development version from `GitHub` using:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("nicholasjclark/mvgam")
```
## Brief Overview

We can explore the modelâ€™s primary functions using a test dataset that
is available with all `R` installations.
