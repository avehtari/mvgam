# *mvgam*

The goal of `mvgam` is to use a Bayesian framework to estimate
parameters of Generalised Additive Models for discrete time series with
dynamic trend components.

## Installation

Install the development version from `GitHub` using:
`devtools::install_github("nicholasjclark/mvgam")`

## Brief introduction to the package

We can explore the model’s primary functions using a test dataset that
is available with all `R` installations. We introduce dynamic
Generalised Additive Models and some of the key utility functions
provided in `mvgam`. First, load the `lynx` data and plot the series as
well as its estimated autocorrelation function

``` r
library(mvgam)
#> Loading required package: mgcv
#> Warning: package 'mgcv' was built under R version 3.6.2

data(lynx)
lynx_full = data.frame(year = 1821:1934, 
                       population = as.numeric(lynx))
plot(lynx_full$population, type = 'l', ylab = 'Lynx trappings',
     xlab = 'Time')
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
acf(lynx_full$population, main = '')
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-2-2.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Along with serial autocorrelation, there is a clear ~19-year cyclic
pattern to the data. Create a `season` term that can be used to model
this effect and give a better representation of the data generating
process than we would likely get with a linear
model

``` r
plot(stl(ts(lynx_full$population, frequency = 19), s.window = 'periodic'))
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
lynx_full$season <- (lynx_full$year %%19) + 1
```

For `mvgam` models, the response needs to be labelled `y` and we also
need an indicator of the series name as a `factor` variable

``` r
lynx_full$y <- lynx_full$population
lynx_full$series <- factor('series1')
```

Split the data into training (first 50 years) and testing (next 10 years
of data) to evaluate multi-step ahead forecasts

``` r
lynx_train = lynx_full[1:50, ]
lynx_test = lynx_full[51:60, ]
```

Now fit an `mvgam` model; it fits a GAM in which a cyclic smooth
function for `season` is estimated jointly with a full time series model
for the errors (in this case an `AR3` process with drift), rather than
relying on smoothing splines that do not incorporate a concept of the
future. We assume the outcome follows a Poisson distribution and
estimate the model in `JAGS` using MCMC sampling (Note that `JAGS` 4.3.0
is required; installation links are found
[here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/))

``` r
lynx_mvgam <- mvjagam(data_train = lynx_train,
               data_test = lynx_test,
               formula = y ~ s(season, bs = 'cc', k = 19),
               knots = list(season = c(0.5, 19.5)),
               family = 'poisson',
               trend_model = 'AR3',
               burnin = 5000)

```

Perform a series of posterior predictive checks to see if the model is
able to simulate data for the training period that looks realistic and
unbiased. First, examine simulated kernel densities for posterior
predictions (`yhat`) and compare to the density of the observations
(`y`)

``` r
plot_mvgam_ppc(lynx_mvgam, series = 1, type = 'density')
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Now plot the distribution of predicted means compared to the observed
mean

``` r
plot_mvgam_ppc(lynx_mvgam, series = 1, type = 'mean')
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Next examine simulated empirical Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDF)
for posterior predictions (`yhat`) and compare to the CDF of the
observations
(`y`)

``` r
plot_mvgam_ppc(lynx_mvgam, series = 1, type = 'cdf')
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-9-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Finally look for any biases in predictions by examining a Probability
Integral Transform (PIT) histogram. If our predictions are not biased
one way or another (i.e. not consistently under- or over-predicting),
this histogram should look roughly
uniform

``` r
plot_mvgam_ppc(lynx_mvgam, series = 1, type = 'pit')
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-10-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

All of these plots indicate the model is well calibrated against the
training data, with no apparent pathological behaviors exhibited. Have a
look at this model’s summary to see what is being estimated (note that
longer MCMC runs would probably be needed to increase effective sample
sizes)

```

Inspect the model’s estimated smooth for the 19-year cyclic pattern.
Note that the `mvgam` smooth plot is on a different scale compared to
`mgcv` plots, but interpretation is
similar

``` r
plot_mvgam_smooth(lynx_mvgam, 1, 'season')
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can also view the mvgam’s posterior retrodictions and predictions for
the entire series (testing and
training)

``` r
plot_mvgam_fc(lynx_mvgam, data_test = lynx_test)
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-13-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

And the estimated latent trend
component

``` r
plot_mvgam_trend(lynx_mvgam, data_test = lynx_test)
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

We can also re-do the posterior predictive checks, but this time
focusing only on the out of sample period. This will give us better
insight into how the model is performing and whether it is able to
simulate realistic and unbiased future
values

``` r
plot_mvgam_ppc(lynx_mvgam, series = 1, type = 'density', data_test = lynx_test)
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-15-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
plot_mvgam_ppc(lynx_mvgam, series = 1, type = 'mean', data_test = lynx_test)
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-16-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
plot_mvgam_ppc(lynx_mvgam, series = 1, type = 'cdf', data_test = lynx_test)
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-17-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

``` r
plot_mvgam_ppc(lynx_mvgam, series = 1, type = 'pit', data_test = lynx_test)
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-18-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

A key aspect of ecological forecasting is to understand [how different
components of a model contribute to forecast
uncertainty](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/eap.1589).
We can estimate relative contributions to forecast uncertainty for the
GAM component and the latent trend component using
`mvgam`

``` r
plot_mvgam_uncertainty(lynx_mvgam, data_test = lynx_test)
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Both components contribute to forecast uncertainty, suggesting we would
still need some more work to learn about factors driving the dynamics of
the system. But we will leave the model as-is for this example.
Diagnostics of the model can also be performed using `mvgam`. Have a
look at the model’s residuals, which are posterior medians of Dunn-Smyth
randomised quantile residuals so should follow approximate normality. We
are primarily looking for a lack of autocorrelation, which would suggest
our AR3 model is appropriate for the latent
trend

``` r
plot_mvgam_resids(lynx_mvgam)
```

<img src="README-unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

Another useful utility of `mvgam` is the ability to use rolling window
forecasts to evaluate competing models that may represent different
hypotheses about the series dynamics. Here we will fit a poorly
specified model to showcase how this evaluation works. In this model, we
ignore the cyclic pattern of seasonality and force it to be fairly
non-wiggly. We also use a random walk process for the trend

``` r
lynx_mvgam_poor <- mvjagam(data_train = lynx_train,
               data_test = lynx_test,
               formula = y ~ s(season, bs = 'gp', k = 3),
               family = 'poisson',
               trend_model = 'RW',
               burnin = 5000)
#> Compiling rjags model...
#> Starting 2 rjags simulations using a PSOCK cluster with 2 nodes on host
#> 'localhost'
#> Simulation complete
#> Note: Summary statistics were not produced as there are >50 monitored
#> variables
#> [To override this behaviour see ?add.summary and ?runjags.options]
#> FALSEFinished running the simulation
#> NOTE: Stopping adaptation
```

We choose a set of timepoints within the training data to forecast from,
allowing us to simulate a situation where the model’s parameters had
already been estimated but we have only observed data up to the
evaluation timepoint and would like to generate forecasts from the
latent trends. Here we use year 10 as our last observation and forecast
ahead for the next 10
years.

``` r
mod1_eval <- eval_mvgam(lynx_mvgam, eval_timepoint = 10, fc_horizon = 10)
mod2_eval <- eval_mvgam(lynx_mvgam_poor, eval_timepoint = 10, fc_horizon = 10)
```

Summary statistics of the two models’ out of sample Discrete Rank
Probability Score (DRPS) indicate that the well-specified model performs
markedly better (far lower DRPS) for this evaluation timepoint

``` r
summary(mod1_eval$series1$drps)
#>    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#>   3.714  18.253  85.392  79.673 110.414 209.886
summary(mod2_eval$series1$drps)
#>    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
#>   51.47   67.17  310.71  302.30  438.29  721.90
```

Nominal coverages for both models’ 90% prediction intervals

``` r
mean(mod1_eval$series1$in_interval)
#> [1] 1
mean(mod2_eval$series1$in_interval)
#> [1] 1
```

The `compare_mvgams` function automates this process by rolling along a
set of timepoints for each model, ensuring a more in-depth evaluation of
each competing model at the same set of timepoints. There are many more
extended uses for `mvgam` models, including the ability to fit dynamic
factor processes for analysing and forecasting sets of multivariate
discrete time series
