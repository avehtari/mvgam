Description: This package is for fitting Bayesian Generalised Additive Models to sets of discrete time series. 
             The primary purpose of this package is to build a version of dynamic linear models that incorporates 
             the flexibility of GAMs for the linear predictor as well as latent trend components that can be useful 
             for time series analysis and forecasting. The package also includes utilities for online updating of 
             forecast distributions using a recursive particle filter
