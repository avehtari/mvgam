\arguments{
\item{smooth}{a smooth object of class \code{"moi.smooth"} or \code{"mod.smooth"}}

\item{model}{an object of class \code{"gam"}}

\item{n}{numeric; the number of points over the range of the covariate at
which to evaluate the smooth.}

\item{n_3d, n_4d}{numeric; the number of points over the range of last
covariate in a 3D or 4D smooth. The default is \code{NULL} which achieves the
standard behaviour of using \code{n} points over the range of all covariate,
resulting in \code{n^d} evaluation points, where \code{d} is the dimension of the
smooth. For \code{d > 2} this can result in very many evaluation points and slow
performance. For smooths of \code{d > 4}, the value of \code{n_4d} will be used for
all dimensions \verb{> 4}, unless this is \code{NULL}, in which case the default
behaviour (using \code{n} for all dimensions) will be observed.}

\item{data}{a data frame of covariate values at which to evaluate the
smooth.}

\item{unconditional}{logical; should confidence intervals include the
uncertainty due to smoothness selection? If \code{TRUE}, the corrected Bayesian
covariance matrix will be used.}

\item{overall_uncertainty}{logical; should the uncertainty in the model
constant term be included in the standard error of the evaluate values of
the smooth?}

\item{dist}{numeric; if greater than 0, this is used to determine when
a location is too far from data to be plotted when plotting 2-D smooths.
The data are scaled into the unit square before deciding what to exclude,
and \code{dist} is a distance within the unit square. See
\code{\link[mgcv:exclude.too.far]{mgcv::exclude.too.far()}} for further details.}

\item{...}{ignored.}
