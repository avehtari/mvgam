\usage{
\method{plot}{mvgam}(
  x,
  type = "residuals",
  series = 1,
  residuals = FALSE,
  newdata,
  data_test,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}. See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{type}{\code{character} specifying which type of plot to return. Options are:
'series,
residuals,
smooths,
re (random effect smooths),
pterms (parametric effects),
forecast,
trend,
uncertainty,
factors}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted. This is ignored
if \code{type == 're'}}

\item{residuals}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} and \code{type = residuals}, posterior quantiles of partial residuals are added
to plots of 1-D smooths as a series of ribbon rectangles.
Partial residuals for a smooth term are the median Dunn-Smyth residuals that would be obtained by dropping the term
concerned from the model, while leaving all other estimates fixed (i.e. the
estimates for the term plus the original median Dunn-Smyth residuals). Note that because \code{mvgam} works with
Dunn-Smyth residuals and not working residuals, which are used by \code{mgcv}, the magnitudes of
partial residuals will be different to what you would expect from \code{\link[mgcv]{plot.gam}}. Interpretation
is similar though, as these partial residuals should be evenly scattered
around the smooth function if the function is well estimated}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series' and 'time'
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of the original \code{formula}.
This argument is optional when plotting out of sample forecast period observations
(when \code{type = forecast}) and required when plotting
uncertainty components (\code{type = uncertainty}).}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{...}{Additional arguments for each individual plotting function.}
}
\value{
A base R plot or set of plots
}
\description{
This function takes a fitted \code{mvgam} object and produces plots of smooth functions, forecasts, trends and
uncertainty components
}
\details{
These plots are useful for getting an overview of the fitted model and its estimated
random effects or smooth functions,
but the individual plotting functions generally offer more customisation.
