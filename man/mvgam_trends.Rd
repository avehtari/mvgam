Supported mvgam trend models
}
\details{
\code{mvgam} currently supports the following dynamic trend models:
\itemize{
\item \code{RW} Random Walk
\item \code{AR1} Autoregressive model with AR coefficient for lag 1
\item \code{AR2} Autoregressive model with AR coefficients for lags 1 and 2
\item \code{AR3} Autoregressive model with AR coefficients for lags 1, 2 and 3
\item \code{VAR1} Vector Autoregressive model with VAR coefficients for lag 1; contemporaneously uncorrelated process errors
\item \code{VAR1cor} Vector Autoregressive model with VAR coefficients for lag 1; contemporaneously correlated process errors
\item \code{VARMA} Vector Autoregressive model with VAR coefficients for lag 1 and MA coefficients for lag 1; contemporaneously correlated process errors
\item \code{GP} Squared exponential Gaussian Process
\item \code{None} No latent trend is fitted
}

Dynamic factor models can be used in which the latent factors evolve as either
\code{RW}, \code{AR1}, \code{AR2}, \code{AR3} or \code{GP}. Note that only \code{RW}, \code{AR1}, \code{AR2} and \code{AR3} are available if
using \code{JAGS}. All trend models are supported if using \code{Stan}. For multivariate trend models
(i.e. \code{VAR} and \code{VARcor} models), users can either fix the trend error covariances to be \code{0}
(using \code{VAR}) or estimate them and potentially allow for contemporaneously correlated errors using
\code{VARcor}. For all \code{VAR} models, stationarity of
the latent process is enforced through the prior using the parameterisation given by
Heaps (2022). Stationarity is not enforced when using \code{AR1}, \code{AR2} or \code{AR3} models,
though this can be changed by the user by specifying lower and upper bounds on autoregressive
parameters using functionality in \link{get_mvgam_priors} and the \code{priors} argument in
\link{mvgam}
