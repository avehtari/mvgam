\title{Summary for a fitted mvjagam object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{mvgam}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}
}
\value{
A \code{list} is printed on-screen showing the summaries for the model
}
\description{
This function takes a fitted \code{mvjagam} object and prints various useful summaries from it
}
\details{
A brief summary of the model's call is printed, along with posterior intervals for
some of the key parameters in the model. Note that some smooths have extra penalties on the null space,
so summaries for the \code{rho} parameters may include more penalty terms than the number of smooths in
the original model formula. The function also returns an approximate smooth term
significance table, but note that this signficance comes with the usual caveats associated with calculations
of p-values for smooth terms in \code{\link[mcgv]{summary.gam}} (i.e. all p-values are computed without
considering uncertainty in the smoothing parameter estimates). The significances are calculated following
