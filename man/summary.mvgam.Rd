\title{Summary for a fitted mvgam object}
\usage{
\method{summary}{mvgam}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}}
}
\value{
A \code{list} is printed on-screen showing the summaries for the model
}
\description{
This function takes a fitted \code{mvgam} object and prints various useful summaries from it
}
\details{
A brief summary of the model's call is printed, along with posterior intervals for
some of the key parameters in the model. Note that some smooths have extra penalties on the null space,
so summaries for the \code{rho} parameters may include more penalty terms than the number of smooths in
the original model formula.
