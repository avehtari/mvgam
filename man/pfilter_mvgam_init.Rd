\title{Initiate particles for online filtering from a fitted mvjagam object}
\usage{
pfilter_mvgam_init(
  object,
  data_assim,
  n_particles = 1000,
  file_path = "pfilter",
  n_cores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{data_assim}{A \code{dataframe} of test data containing at least one more observation per series
(beyond the last observation seen by the model in \code{object} to be assimilated by the particle filter.
Should at least contain 'series', 'season', 'year' and in_season' for the one-step ahead horizon,
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{object}}

\item{n_particles}{\code{integer} specifying the number of unique particles to generate for tracking the
latent system state}

\item{file_path}{\code{character} string specifying the file path for saving the initiated particles}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating particle forecasts in parallel}
}
\description{
This function generates a set of particles that each captures a unique proposal about
the current state of the system. The next observation is assimilated
and particles are weighted by their proposal's multivariate composite likelihood when considering the next
observation in \code{data_assim} (i.e. the next season's observation for each series)
