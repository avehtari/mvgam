\title{Initiate particles for online filtering from a fitted mvjagam object}
\usage{
pfilter_mvgam_init(
  object,
  data_assim,
  n_particles = 1000,
  file_path = "pfilter",
  n_cores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{data_assim}{A \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least one more observation per series
(beyond the last observation seen by the model in \code{object}) to be assimilated by the particle filter.
Should at least contain 'series', 'season' and 'year' for the one-step ahead horizon,
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{object}}

\item{n_particles}{\code{integer} specifying the number of unique particles to generate for tracking the
latent system state}

\item{file_path}{\code{character} string specifying the file path for saving the initiated particles}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating particle forecasts in parallel}
}
\value{
A \code{list} object of \code{length = n_particles} containing information on parameters and
current state estimates for each particle is generated and saved, along with other important information
from the original model, to an \code{.rda} object in \code{file_path}
}
\description{
This function generates a set of particles that each captures a unique proposal about
the current state of the system. The next observation in \code{data_assim} is assimilated
and particles are weighted by their proposal's multivariate composite likelihood to update the model's
forecast distribution
