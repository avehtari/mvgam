\title{Initiate particles for online filtering from a fitted mvjagam object}
\usage{
pfilter_mvgam_init(
  object,
  data_train,
  data_assim,
  n_particles = 1000,
  file_path = "pfilter"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{data_train}{A \code{dataframe} containing the model response variable and covariates
required by the GAM \code{formula}. Should include columns:
'y' (the discrete outcomes; NAs allowed)
'series' (character or factor index of the series IDs)
'season' (numeric index of the seasonal time point for each observation; should not have any missing)
'year' the numeric index for year, and
'in_season' indicator for whether the observation is in season or not. If the counts tend to go to zero
during the off season (as in tick counts for example), setting 'in_season' to zero cduring these seasonal periods
can be useful as trends won't contribute during
during this time but they continue to evolve, allowing the trend to continue evolving rather than forcing
it to zero during the off-season
Any other variables to be included in the linear predictor of \code{formula} must also be present}

\item{data_assim}{A \code{dataframe} of test data containing at least one more observation (beyond the last observation
seen by the model in \code{object} to be assimilated by the particle filter. Should at least contain 'series', 'season', 'year' and
'in_season' for the one-step ahead horizon, in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{object}}

\item{n_particles}{\code{integer} specifying the number of unique particles to generate for tracking the latent system state}

\item{file_path}{\code{character} string specifying the file path for saving the initiated particles}
}
\description{
This function generates a set of particles that each captures a unique proposal about
the current state of the system that was modelled in the mvjagam object. The next observation is assimilated
and particles are weighted by their proposal's discrete rank probability score
