\title{Plot mvgam posterior predictions for a specified series}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_fc(
  object,
  series = 1,
  data_test,
  realisations = FALSE,
  n_realisations = 15,
  hide_xlabels = FALSE,
  ylab,
  ylim,
  return_forecasts = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{data_test}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series' and 'time'
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If included, the
covariate information in \code{data_test} will be used to generate forecasts from the fitted model equations. If
this same \code{data_test} was originally included in the call to \code{mvgam}, then forecasts have already been
produced by the generative model and these will simply be extracted and plotted. However if no \code{data_test} was
supplied to the original model call, an assumption is made that the \code{data_test} supplied here comes sequentially
after the data supplied as \code{data_train} in the original model (i.e. we assume there is no time gap between the last
observation of series 1 in \code{data_train} and the first observation for series 1 in \code{data_test}). If
\code{data_test} contains observations in column \code{y}, these observations will be used to compute a Discrete Rank
Probability Score for the forecast distribution}

\item{realisations}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, forecast realisations are shown as a spaghetti plot,
making it easier to visualise the diversity of possible forecasts. If \code{FALSE}, the default,
empirical quantiles of the forecast distribution are shown}

\item{n_realisations}{\code{integer} specifying the number of posterior realisations to plot, if
\code{realisations = TRUE}. Ignored otherwise}

\item{hide_xlabels}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, no xlabels are printed to allow the user to add custom labels using
\code{axis} from base \code{R}}

\item{ylab}{Optional \code{character} string specifying the y-axis label}

\item{ylim}{Optional \code{vector} of y-axis limits (min, max)}

\item{return_forecasts}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, the function will plot the forecast
as well as returning the forecast object (as a \code{matrix} of dimension \code{n_samples} x \code{horizon})}
}
\value{
A base \code{R} graphics plot and an optional \code{matrix} of the forecast distribution
}
\description{
Plot mvgam posterior predictions for a specified series
}
\details{
Posterior predictions are drawn from the fitted \code{mvgam} and used to calculate posterior
empirical quantiles. If \code{realisations = FALSE}, these posterior quantiles are plotted along
with the true observed data that was used to train the model. Otherwise, a spaghetti plot is returned
to show possible forecast paths.
