\title{Update an existing \code{mvgam} object}
\usage{
\method{update}{mvgam}(object, formula, data, newdata, trend_model, use_lv, n_lv, family, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted \code{mvgam} model}

\item{formula}{A new \code{formula} object. Note, \code{mvgam} currently does not support dynamic formula
updates such as removal of specific terms with \code{- term}. When updating, the entire formula needs
to be supplied}

\item{data}{A \code{dataframe} or \code{list} containing the model response variable and covariates
required by the GAM \code{formula}. Should include columns:
'series' (character or factor index of the series IDs)
'time' (numeric index of the time point for each observation).
Any other variables to be included in the linear predictor of \code{formula} must also be present}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series' and 'time'
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If included, the
observations in variable \code{y} will be set to \code{NA} when fitting the model so that posterior
simulations can be obtained}

\item{trend_model}{\code{character} specifying the time series dynamics for the latent trend. Options are:
'None' (no latent trend component; i.e. the GAM component is all that contributes to the linear predictor,
and the observation process is the only source of error; similarly to what is estimated by \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}}),
'RW' (random walk with possible drift),
'AR1' (with possible drift),
'AR2' (with possible drift) or
'AR3' (with possible drift) or
'VAR1' (with possible drift; only available in \code{Stan}) or
'GP' (Gaussian Process with squared exponential kernel;
only available in \code{stan})}

\item{use_lv}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, use dynamic factors to estimate series'
latent trends in a reduced dimension format. If \code{FALSE}, estimate independent latent trends for each series}

\item{n_lv}{\code{integer} the number of latent dynamic factors to use if \code{use_lv == TRUE}.
Cannot be \code{>n_series}. Defaults arbitrarily to \code{min(2, floor(n_series / 2))}}

\item{family}{\code{family} specifying the exponential observation family for the series. Currently supported
families are: \code{nb()}, \code{poisson()}, \code{tweedie()}, \code{gaussian()}, \code{betar()}, \code{lognormal()}, \code{student_t()} and \code{Gamma()}}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed to \code{\link{mvgam}}}

\description{
This function allows a previously fitted \code{mvgam} model to be updated
