\title{Update an existing \code{mvgam} object}
\usage{
\method{update}{mvgam}(object, formula, data, newdata, trend_model, use_lv, n_lv, family, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{A new \code{formula} object. Note, \code{mvgam} currently does not support dynamic formula
updates such as removal of specific terms with \code{- term}. When updating, the entire formula needs
to be supplied}

\item{data}{A \code{dataframe} or \code{list} containing the model response variable and covariates
required by the GAM \code{formula}. Should include columns:
'series' (character or factor index of the series IDs)
'time' (numeric index of the time point for each observation).
Any other variables to be included in the linear predictor of \code{formula} must also be present}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series' and 'time'
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If included, the
observations in variable \code{y} will be set to \code{NA} when fitting the model so that posterior
simulations can be obtained}

\item{...}{Other arguments to be passed to \code{\link{mvgam}}}
}
\description{
This function allows a previously fitted \code{mvgam} model to be updated
}
