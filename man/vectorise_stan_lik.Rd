\usage{
vectorise_stan_lik(
  model_file,
  model_data,
  family = "Poisson",
  trend_model = "None",
  offset = FALSE,
  threads = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_file}{Stan model file to be edited}

\item{model_data}{Prepared mvgam data for Stan modelling}

\item{family}{\code{character}. Must be either 'Negative Binomial' or 'Poisson'}

\item{trend_model}{\code{character} specifying the time series dynamics for the latent trend. Options are:
'None' (no latent trend component; i.e. the GAM component is all that contributes to the linear predictor,
and the observation process is the only source of error; similarly to what is estimated by \code{\link[mcgv]{gam}}),
'RW' (random walk with possible drift),
'AR1' (AR1 model with intercept),
'AR2' (AR2 model with intercept) or
'AR3' (AR3 model with intercept) or
'GP' (Gaussian process with squared exponential kernel; currently under development and
only available for estimation in \code{stan})}

\item{offset}{\code{logical}}

\item{threads}{\code{integer} Experimental option to use multithreading for within-chain
parallelisation in \code{Stan}. We recommend its use only if you are experienced with
\code{Stan}'s \code{reduce_sum} function and have a slow running model that cannot be sped
up by any other means}
