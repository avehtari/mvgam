\title{Forecast from a particle filtered mvjagam object}
\usage{
pfilter_mvgam_fc(file_path = "pfilter", n_cores = 2, data_test)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{\code{character} string specifying the file path where the particles have been saved}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating particle forecasts in parallel}

\item{data_test}{A \code{dataframe} of test data containing at least 'series', 'season', 'year' and
'in_season' for the forecast horizon, in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}}
}
\description{
This function generates a forecast from a set of particles that each captures a unique proposal about
the current state of the system that was modelled in the mvjagam object. The covariate and timepoint information
from \code{data_test} is used to generate the gam component forecast, while the trends are run forward in time
according to their state space dynamics
