\title{Forecast from a particle filtered mvjagam object}
\usage{
pfilter_mvgam_fc(
  file_path = "pfilter",
  n_cores = 2,
  data_test,
  legend_position = "topleft",
  return_forecasts = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{file_path}{\code{character} string specifying the file path where the particles have been saved}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating particle forecasts in parallel}

\item{data_test}{A \code{dataframe} of test data containing at least 'series', 'season', 'year' and
'in_season' for the forecast horizon, in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}}

\item{legend_position}{The location may also be specified by setting x to a single keyword from the
list "bottomright", "bottom", "bottomleft", "left", "topleft", "top", "topright", "right" and "center".
This places the legend on the inside of the plot frame at the given location.}

\item{return_forecasts}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, the returned list object will contain plots of forecasts
as well as the forecast objects (each as a \code{matrix} of dimension \code{n_particles} x \code{horizon})}
}
\value{
A named \code{list} contaning functions that call base \code{R} plots of each series' forecast. Optionally
the actual forecasts are returned within the \code{list} as a separate \code{list} of \code{matrices}
}
\description{
This function generates a forecast from a set of particles that each capture a unique proposal about
the current state of the system that was modelled in the mvjagam object. The covariate and timepoint information
from \code{data_test} is used to generate the GAM component forecast, while the trends are run forward in time
according to their state space dynamics. The forecast is a weighted ensemble, with weights determined by
each particle's proposal likelihood prior to the most recent assimilation step
