\title{Plot mvjagam posterior predictive checks for a specified series}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_ppc(object, data_test, series, type = "density", legend_position)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{data_test}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series', 'season' and 'year'
for the forecast horizon, in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If
included, the observed values in the test data are compared to the model's forecast distribution for exploring
biases in model predictions.
Note this is only useful if the same \code{data_test} was also included when fitting the original model.}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{type}{\code{character} specifying the type of posterior predictive check to calculate and plot.
Valid options are: 'mean', 'density', 'pit' and 'cdf'}

\item{legend_position}{The location may also be specified by setting x to a single keyword from the
list "bottomright", "bottom", "bottomleft", "left", "topleft", "top", "topright", "right" and "center".
This places the legend on the inside of the plot frame at the given location.}
}
\value{
A base \code{R} graphics plot showing either the predicted vs observed mean for the
series (for \code{type == 'mean'}), kernel density or empirical CDF estimates for
posterior predictions (for \code{type == 'density'} or \code{type == 'cdf'}) or a Probability
Integral Transform histogram (for \code{type == 'pit'})
}
\description{
Plot mvjagam posterior predictive checks for a specified series
}
\details{
Posterior predictions are drawn from the fitted \code{mvjagam} and compared against
the empirical distribution of the observed data for a specified series to help evaluate the model's
ability to generate unbiased predictions.
