\title{Plot mvjagam trace plots}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_trace(object, param = "rho", overlay_prior = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{param}{\code{character} vector specifying which parameter(s) are to be plotted. Valid options are:
'rho' (smoothing penalties), 'b' (traces for all smooth beta coefficients)}

\item{overlay_prior}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} and \code{param} is 'rho' or 'trend', the default prior densities
are also shown to evaluate how informative the data were for shaping the posterior estimates. Note that these
densities assume that the priors for 'rho', 'ar' and 'tau' were not changed from their default values when the
model was originaly fitted
\code{newdata} just as you would when predicting from a \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} model}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[MCMCvis]{MCMCtrace}} traceplot.
}
\description{
This function returns MCMC trace plots for the specified parameter(s)
