\usage{
ZMVN(unit = time, gr = NA, subgr = series)
}
\arguments{
\item{unit}{The unquoted name of the variable that represents the unit of analysis in \code{data} over
which latent residuals should be correlated. This variable should be either a
\code{numeric} or \code{integer} variable in the supplied \code{data}.
Defaults to \code{time} to be consistent with other functionalities
in \pkg{mvgam}, though note that the data need not be time series in this case. See examples below
for further details and explanations}

\item{gr}{An optional grouping variable, which must be a \code{factor} in the supplied \code{data},
for setting up hierarchical residual correlation structures. If specified,
this will automatically set up a model where the
residual correlations for a specific level of \code{gr} are modelled hierarchically:
\eqn{\Omega_{group} = p\Omega_{global} + (1 - p)\Omega_{group, local}},
where \eqn{\Omega_{global}} is a \emph{global} correlation
matrix, \eqn{\Omega_{group, local}} is a \emph{local deviation} correlation matrix
and \eqn{p} is a weighting parameter
controlling how strongly the local correlation matrix \eqn{\Omega_{group}} is shrunk towards the global
correlation matrix \eqn{\Omega_{global}}. If \code{gr} is supplied then \code{subgr} \emph{must} also be supplied}

\item{subgr}{A subgrouping \code{factor} variable specifying which element in \code{data} represents the
different observational units. Defaults to \code{series} to be consistent with other functionalities
in \pkg{mvgam}, though note that the data need not be time series in this case.
But note that models that use the hierarchical correlations (by supplying a value for \code{gr})
\emph{should not} include a \code{series} element in \code{data}. Rather, this element will be created internally based
on the supplied variables for \code{gr} and \code{subgr}. For example, if you are modelling
counts for a group of species (labelled as \code{species} in the data) across sampling sites
(labelled as \code{site} in the data) in three
different geographical regions (labelled as \code{region}), and you would like the residuals to be correlated
within regions, then you should specify
\code{unit = site},  \code{gr = region}, and \code{subgr = species}. Internally, \code{mvgam()} will appropriately order
the data by \code{unit} (in this case, by \code{site}) and create
the \code{series} element for the data using something like: \code{series = as.factor(paste0(group, '_', subgroup))}}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mvgam_trend}, which contains a list of
arguments to be interpreted by the parsing functions in \pkg{mvgam}
}
\description{
Set up latent correlated multivariate Gaussian residual processes
in \pkg{mvgam}. This function does not evaluate it's arguments â€“
it exists purely to help set up a model with particular error processes.
