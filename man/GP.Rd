\arguments{
\item{...}{ignored.}

\item{smooth}{a smooth object of class \code{"gp.smooth"}, returned from a model using either the
\code{dynamic()} function or the \code{gp()} function, which both make use of with a Hilbert
space approximate GPs}

\item{model}{an object of class \code{"gam"}}

\item{n}{numeric; the number of points over the range of the covariate at
which to evaluate the smooth.}

\item{n_3d, n_4d}{numeric; the number of points over the range of last
covariate in a 3D or 4D smooth. The default is \code{NULL} which achieves the
standard behaviour of using \code{n} points over the range of all covariate,
resulting in \code{n^d} evaluation points, where \code{d} is the dimension of the
smooth. For \code{d > 2} this can result in very many evaluation points and slow
performance. For smooths of \code{d > 4}, the value of \code{n_4d} will be used for
all dimensions \verb{> 4}, unless this is \code{NULL}, in which case the default
behaviour (using \code{n} for all dimensions) will be observed.}

\item{data}{a data frame of covariate values at which to evaluate the
smooth.}

\item{unconditional}{logical; should confidence intervals include the
uncertainty due to smoothness selection? If \code{TRUE}, the corrected Bayesian
covariance matrix will be used.}

\item{overall_uncertainty}{logical; should the uncertainty in the model
constant term be included in the standard error of the evaluate values of
the smooth?}

\item{dist}{numeric; if greater than 0, this is used to determine when
a location is too far from data to be plotted when plotting 2-D smooths.
The data are scaled into the unit square before deciding what to exclude,
and \code{dist} is a distance within the unit square. See
\code{\link[mgcv:exclude.too.far]{mgcv::exclude.too.far()}} for further details.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mvgam_trend}, which contains a list of
arguments to be interpreted by the parsing functions in \code{mvgam}
}
\description{
Set up low-rank approximate Gaussian Process trend models using Hilbert
basis expansions in \code{mvgam}. This function does not evaluate its arguments â€“
it exists purely to help set up a model with particular GP
trend models.
}
\details{
A GP trend is estimated for each series using
\href{https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11408}{Hilbert space approximate Gaussian Processes}.
In \code{mvgam}, latent squared exponential GP trends are approximated using by
default \code{20} basis functions and using a multiplicative factor of \code{c = 5/4},
which saves computational costs compared to fitting full GPs while adequately estimating
GP \code{alpha} and \code{rho} parameters.
