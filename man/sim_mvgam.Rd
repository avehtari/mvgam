\title{Fit a Bayesian multivariate GAM to a set of discrete time series}
\usage{
sim_mvgam(
  T = 100,
  n_series = 3,
  seasonality = "shared",
  n_trends = 5,
  trend_rel,
  freq = 12,
  size_obs,
  mu_obs,
  prop_missing = 0,
  train_prop
)
}
\arguments{
\item{T}{\code{integer}. Number of observations (timepoints)}

\item{n_series}{\code{integer}. Number of discrete time series}

\item{seasonality}{\code{character}. Either \code{shared}, meaning that all series share the exact same seasonal pattern,
or \code{hierarchical}, meaning that there is a global seasonality but each series' pattern can deviate slightly}

\item{n_trends}{\code{integer}. Number of latent dynamic factors (as random walks with drift) for generating the series' trends}

\item{trend_rel}{\code{numeric}. Relative importance of the trend for each series. Should be between \code{0} and \code{1}}

\item{freq}{\code{integer}. The seasonal frequency of the series}

\item{size_obs}{\code{vector} of negative binomial size parameters for the series}

\item{mu_obs}{\code{vector} of negative binomial mu parameters for the series}

\item{prop_missing}{\code{numeric} stating proportion of observations that are missing}

\item{train_prop}{\code{numeric} stating the proportion of data to use for training. Should be between \code{0.25} and \code{0.75}}
}
\value{
A \code{list} object containing outputs needed for \code{\link{mvjagam}}, including 'data_train' and 'data_test',
as well as some additional information about the simulated seasonality and trend dependencies
}
\description{
This function simulates discrete time series data for fitting a multivariate GAM that includes
shared seasonality and dependence on state-space latent dynamic factors. Random dependencies among series, i.e.
correlations in their long-term trends, are included in the form of correlated loadings on the latent dynamic factors
