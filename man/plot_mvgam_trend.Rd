\title{Plot mvjagam latent trend for a specified series}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_trend(object, series, data_test, data_train)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{data_test}{A \code{dataframe} containing at least 'series', 'season', 'year' and 'in_season' for the forecast horizon, in
addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}}

\item{data_train}{A \code{dataframe} containing the model response variable and covariates
required by the GAM \code{formula}. Should include columns:
'y' (the discrete outcomes; NAs allowed)
'series' (character or factor index of the series IDs)
'season' (numeric index of the seasonal time point for each observation; should not have any missing)
'year' the numeric index for year
'in_season' indicator for whether the observation is in season or not. If the counts tend to go to zero
during the off season (as in tick counts for example), setting this to zero can be useful as trends won't contribute during
during this time but they continue to evolve, allowing the trend from the past season to continue evolving rather than forcing
it to zero
Any other variables to be included in the linear predictor of \code{formula} must also be present}
