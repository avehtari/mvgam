\title{Plot mvjagam posterior predictions for a specified series}
\usage{
predict_mvgam(object, series = 1, newdata, type = "link")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{newdata}{A \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series', 'season' and 'year'
for prediction, in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link} (default) the linear predictor is calculated on the log link scale.
When \code{response} is used, the predictions take uncertainty in the obsevation process into account to return
predictions on the outcome (discrete) scale. Note that for both sets of predictions, the temporal
dynamics of any fitted latent trends will be ignored but the precisions of latent trends / factors will
be used to give more realistic estimates of uncertainty surrounding predictions. In essence, the predictions are what
the model would expect to see if the latent trends were all centred at \code{zero}}
}
\value{
A \code{matrix} of dimension \code{n_samples x new_obs}, where \code{n_samples} is the number of
posterior samples from the fitted object and \code{n_obs} is the number of test observations in \code{newdata}
in which the \code{series} variable matches the suppled \code{series} argument
}
\description{
Plot mvjagam posterior predictions for a specified series
}
\details{
Posterior predictions are calculated from the fitted \code{mvjagam} object.
