\title{Plot mvgam posterior predictions for a specified series}
\usage{
\method{predict}{mvgam}(object, series = 1, newdata, data_test, type = "link", n_cores = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be predicted}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series' and 'time
for prediction, in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If not supplied,
predictions are generated for the original observations used for the model fit.}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link} (default) the linear predictor is calculated on the log link scale.
When \code{response} is used, the predictions take uncertainty in the observation process into account to return
predictions on the outcome (discrete) scale.}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating predictions in parallel}
}
\value{
A \code{matrix} of dimension \code{n_samples x new_obs}, where \code{n_samples} is the number of
posterior samples from the fitted object and \code{n_obs} is the number of test observations in \code{newdata}
in which the \code{series} variable matches the supplied \code{series} argument
}
\description{
Plot mvgam posterior predictions for a specified series
}
\details{
Note that for both sets of predictions, the temporal
dynamics of any fitted latent trends will be ignored but the precisions of latent trends / factors, or the
covariance function if a Gaussian process trend was implemented in the model, will
be used to give more realistic estimates of uncertainty surrounding predictions. In essence, the predictions are what
the model would expect to see if the latent trends were all centred at \code{zero}. This function is therefore more
suited to posterior simulation for interrogating a model's estimated smooth functions, while the forecasting functions
\code{\link{plot_mvgam_fc}} and \code{\link{forecast.mvgam}} are better suited to generate h-step ahead forecasts
that respect the temporal dynamics of estimated latent trends.
