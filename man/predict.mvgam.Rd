\title{Predict from the GAM component of an mvgam model}
\usage{
\method{predict}{mvgam}(object, newdata, data_test, type = "link", n_cores = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing the
variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If not supplied,
predictions are generated for the original observations used for the model fit.}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link} (default) the linear predictor is calculated on the link scale.
If \code{expected} is used, predictions reflect the expectation of the response (the mean)
but ignore uncertainty in the observation process. When \code{response} is used, the predictions take uncertainty in the observation process into account to return
predictions on the outcome scale}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating predictions in parallel}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
A \code{matrix} of dimension \code{n_samples x new_obs}, where \code{n_samples} is the number of
posterior samples from the fitted object and \code{n_obs} is the number of test observations in \code{newdata}
}
\description{
Predict from the GAM component of an mvgam model
}
\details{
Note that for all types of predictions, expected uncertainty in the process model is
accounted for only by using draws from the trend  SD parameters. If a \code{trend_formula}
was supplied in the model, predictions for this component will
also be incorporated. But the trend predictions will ignore autocorrelation
coefficients or GP length scale coefficients, ultimately assuming the process is stationary.
This method is similar to the types of posterior predictions returned from \code{brms} models
when using autocorrelated error predictions for newdata.
This function is therefore more suited to posterior simulation from the GAM components
of a \code{mvgam} model, while the forecasting functions
\code{\link{plot_mvgam_fc}} and \code{\link{forecast.mvgam}} are better suited to generate h-step ahead forecasts
that respect the temporal dynamics of estimated latent trends.
