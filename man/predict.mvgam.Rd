\title{Predict from the GAM component of an mvgam model}
\usage{
\method{predict}{mvgam}(object, newdata, data_test, type = "link", process_error = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object of class \code{mvgam}}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing the
variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If not supplied,
predictions are generated for the original observations used for the model fit.}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link} (default) the linear predictor is calculated on the link scale.
If \code{expected} is used, predictions reflect the expectation of the response (the mean)
but ignore uncertainty in the observation process. When \code{response} is used,
the predictions take uncertainty in the observation process into account to return
predictions on the outcome scale}

\item{process_error}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} and a dynamic trend model was fit,
expected uncertainty in the process model is accounted for by using draws
from the latent trend SD parameters. If \code{FALSE}, uncertainty in the latent trend
component is ignored when calculating predictions}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
A \code{matrix} of dimension \code{n_samples x new_obs}, where \code{n_samples} is the number of
posterior samples from the fitted object and \code{n_obs} is the number of test observations in \code{newdata}
}
\description{
Predict from the GAM component of an mvgam model
}
\details{
Note that for all types of predictions for models that did not include
a \code{trend_formula}, uncertainty in the dynamic trend
component can be ignored by setting \code{process_error = FALSE}. However,
if a \code{trend_formula} was supplied in the model, predictions for this component cannot be
ignored. If \code{process_error = TRUE}, trend predictions will ignore autocorrelation
coefficients or GP length scale coefficients, ultimately assuming the process is stationary.
This method is similar to the types of posterior predictions returned from \code{brms} models
when using autocorrelated error predictions for newdata.
This function is therefore more suited to posterior simulation from the GAM components
of a \code{mvgam} model, while the forecasting functions
\code{\link{plot_mvgam_fc}} and \code{\link{forecast.mvgam}} are better suited to generate h-step ahead forecasts
that respect the temporal dynamics of estimated latent trends.
