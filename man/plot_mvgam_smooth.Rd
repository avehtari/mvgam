\title{Plot mvjagam smooth terms}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_smooth(
  object,
  series = 1,
  smooth,
  residuals = FALSE,
  derivatives = FALSE,
  newdata
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{smooth}{either a \code{character} or \code{integer} specifying which smooth term to be plotted}

\item{residuals}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE} then 100 posterior draws of partial residuals are added
to plots of 1-D smooths.
Partial residuals for a smooth term are the median Dunn-Smyth residuals that would be obtained by dropping the term
concerned from the model, while leaving all other estimates fixed (i.e. the
estimates for the term plus the original median Dunn-Smyth residuals). Note that because \code{mvgam} works with
Dunn-Smyth residuals and not working residuals, which are used by \code{mgcv}, the magnitudes of
partial residuals will be different to what you would expect from \code{\link[mgcv]{plot.gam}}. Interpretation
is similar though, as these partial residuals should be evenly scattered
around the smooth function if the function is well estimated}

\item{derivatives}{\code{logical}. If \code{TRUE}, an additional plot will be returned to show the
estimated 1st derivative for the specified smooth (Note, this only works for univariate smooths)}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} for predicting the smooth, containing at least 'series', 'season' and 'year',
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of the original model's \code{formula}.
Note that this currently is only supported for plotting univariate smooths}
}
\value{
A base \code{R} graphics plot
}
\description{
This function plots credible intervals for a series-specific smooth term on the scale of the linear predictor
}
\details{
Smooth functions are shown as empirical quantiles of posterior partial expectations
across a sequence of 500 values between the variable's \code{min} and \code{max},
while zeroing out effects of all other variables. At present, only univariate and bivariate smooth plots
are allowed, though note that bivariate smooths rely on default behaviour from
\code{\link[mgcv]{plot.gam}}. For more nuanced visualisation, supply
\code{newdata} just as you would when predicting from a \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} model
