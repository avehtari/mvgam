\title{Plot mvjagam smooth terms}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_smooth(object, series, smooth, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} for predicting the smooth, containing at least 'series', 'season', 'year',
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of the original model's \code{formula}}
}
\value{
A base \code{R} graphics plot
}
\description{
This function plots credible intervals for a series-specific smooth term on the scale of the linear predictor
}
\details{
Smooth functions are shown as the expectation from the GAM component of the linear predictor across
a sequence of 100 values between the variable's \code{min} and \code{max}, while holding all other variables either at
their means (for numeric varibles) or at the first level (factor variables). At present, only univariate smooth plots
are allowed (no smooth interactions can be plotted). For more nuanced visualisation, supply
\code{newdata} just as you would when predicting from a \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} model
