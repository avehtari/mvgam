\title{Plot mvjagam credible intervals for a series-specific smooth term. At present, only univariate smooth plots
are allowed (no smooth interactions can be plotted)}
\usage{
plot_mvgam_smooth(object, series, smooth, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} for predicting the smooth, containing at least 'series', 'season', 'year',
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of the original model's \code{formula}}
