\title{Plot mvjagam posterior predictive checks for a specified series}
\usage{
\method{ppc}{mvgam}(
  object,
  data_test,
  series = 1,
  type = "density",
  n_bins = 50,
  legend_position
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{data_test}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series' and 'time'
for the forecast horizon, in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of \code{formula}. If
included, the observed values in the test data are compared to the model's forecast distribution for exploring
biases in model predictions.
Note this is only useful if the same \code{data_test} was also included when fitting the original model.}

\item{series}{\code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be plotted}

\item{type}{\code{character} specifying the type of posterior predictive check to calculate and plot.
Valid options are: 'rootogram', 'mean', 'density', 'pit' and 'cdf'}

\item{n_bins}{\code{integer} specifying the number of bins to use for binning observed values when plotting
a rootogram. Default is to use \code{50} bins, which means that if there are \verb{>50} unique observed values, bins will
be used to prevent overplotting and facilitate interpretation}

\item{legend_position}{The location may also be specified by setting x to a single keyword from the
list "bottomright", "bottom", "bottomleft", "left", "topleft", "top", "topright", "right" and "center".
This places the legend on the inside of the plot frame at the given location.}
}
\value{
A base \code{R} graphics plot showing either a posterior rootogram (for \code{type == 'rootogram'}),
the predicted vs observed mean for the
series (for \code{type == 'mean'}), kernel density or empirical CDF estimates for
posterior predictions (for \code{type == 'density'} or \code{type == 'cdf'}) or a Probability
Integral Transform histogram (for \code{type == 'pit'}).
}
\description{
Plot mvjagam posterior predictive checks for a specified series
}
\details{
Posterior predictions are drawn from the fitted \code{mvjagam} and compared against
the empirical distribution of the observed data for a specified series to help evaluate the model's
ability to generate unbiased predictions. For all plots apart from the 'rootogram', posterior predictions
can also be compared to out of sample observations as long as these observations were included as
'data_test' in the original model fit and supplied here. Rootograms are currently only plotted using the
'hanging' style
