\title{Extract or compute hindcasts and forecasts for a fitted \code{mvgam} object}
\usage{
forecast(object, ...)

\method{forecast}{mvgam}(
  object,
  newdata,
  data_test,
  series = "all",
  n_cores = 1,
  type = "response",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}. See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{...}{Ignored}

\item{newdata}{Optional \code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing at least 'series' and 'time'
in addition to any other variables included in the linear predictor of the original \code{formula}. If included, the
covariate information in \code{newdata} will be used to generate forecasts from the fitted model equations. If
this same \code{newdata} was originally included in the call to \code{mvgam}, then forecasts have already been
produced by the generative model and these will simply be extracted and plotted. However if no \code{newdata} was
supplied to the original model call, an assumption is made that the \code{newdata} supplied here comes sequentially
after the data supplied as \code{data} in the original model (i.e. we assume there is no time gap between the last
observation of series 1 in \code{data} and the first observation for series 1 in \code{newdata})}

\item{data_test}{Deprecated. Still works in place of \code{newdata} but users are recommended to use
\code{newdata} instead for more seamless integration into \code{R} workflows}

\item{series}{Either a \code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be forecast,
or the character string \code{'all'}, specifying that all series should be forecast. This is preferable
if the fitted model contained multivariate trends (either as a dynamic factor or \code{VAR} process),
as it saves recomputing the full set of trends for each series individually}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating forecasts in parallel}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link}, the linear predictor is calculated on the log link scale.
When \code{response} is used, the predictions take uncertainty in the observation process into account to return
predictions on the outcome (discrete) scale (default). When \code{trend} is used, only the forecast distribution for the
latent trend is returned}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mvgam_forecast} containing hindcast and forecast distributions.
