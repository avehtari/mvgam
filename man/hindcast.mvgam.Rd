\title{Extract hindcasts for a fitted \code{mvgam} object}
\usage{
hindcast(object, ...)

\method{hindcast}{mvgam}(object, series = "all", n_cores = 1, type = "response", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}. See \code{\link[=mvgam]{mvgam()}}}

\item{...}{Ignored}

\item{series}{Either a \code{integer} specifying which series in the set is to be forecast,
or the character string \code{'all'}, specifying that all series should be forecast. This is preferable
if the fitted model contained multivariate trends (either as a dynamic factor or \code{VAR} process),
as it saves recomputing the full set of trends for each series individually}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link}, the linear predictor is calculated on the log link scale.
When \code{response} is used, the predictions take uncertainty in the observation process into account to return
predictions on the outcome (discrete) scale (default). When \code{trend} is used, only the forecast distribution for the
latent trend is returned}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mvgam_forecast} containing hindcast distributions
for the required series
}
\description{
Extract hindcasts for a fitted \code{mvgam} object
}
\details{
Posterior retrodictions are drawn from the fitted \code{mvgam} and
organized into a convenient format
}
