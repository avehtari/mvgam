\title{Evaluate forecasts from a fitted mvjagam object using a rolling window}
\usage{
roll_eval_mvgam(
  object,
  n_evaluations,
  evaluation_seq,
  n_samples = 5000,
  fc_horizon = 3,
  n_cores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvjagam}}

\item{n_evaluations}{\code{integer} specifying the total number of evaluations to perform
(ignored if \code{evaluation_seq} is supplied)}

\item{evaluation_seq}{Optional \code{integer sequence} specifying the exact set of timepoints for
evaluating the model's forecasts. This sequence cannot have values
\code{<3} or \code{> max(training timepoints) - fc_horizon}}

\item{n_samples}{\code{integer} specifying the number of samples to generate from the model's
posterior distribution}

\item{fc_horizon}{\code{integer} specifying the length of the forecast horizon for evaluating forecasts}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating particle forecasts in parallel}
}
\value{
A \code{list} object containing information on specific evaluations for each series as well as
a total evaluation summary (taken by summing the DRPS for each series at each evaluation and averaging
the coverages at each evaluation)
}
\description{
This function sets up a sequence of evaluation timepoints along a rolling window and iteratively
calls \code{eval_mvgam} to evaluate 'out-of-sample' forecasts.
Evaluation involves calculating the Discrete Rank Probability Score and a binary indicator
for whether or not the true value lies within the forecast's 90\% prediction interval
