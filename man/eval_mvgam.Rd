\title{Evaluate forecasts from a fitted mvgam object at a specific timepoint}
\usage{
eval_mvgam(
  object,
  n_samples = 5000,
  eval_timepoint = 3,
  fc_horizon = 3,
  n_cores = 2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{list} object returned from \code{mvgam}}

\item{n_samples}{\code{integer} specifying the number of samples to generate from the model's
posterior distribution}

\item{eval_timepoint}{\code{integer} indexing the timepoint that represents our last 'observed'
set of outcome data}

\item{fc_horizon}{\code{integer} specifying the length of the forecast horizon for evaluating forecasts}

\item{n_cores}{\code{integer} specifying number of cores for generating particle forecasts in parallel}
}
\value{
A \code{list} object containing information on specific evaluations for each series
}
\description{
This function generates a set of samples representing fixed parameters estimated from the full
\code{mvgam} model and latent trend states at a given point in time. The trends are rolled forward
a total of \code{fc_horizon} timesteps according to their estimated state space dynamics to
generate an 'out-of-sample' forecast that is evaluated against the true observations in the horizon window.
This function therefore simulates a situation where the model's parameters had already been estimated but
we have only observed data up to the evaluation timepoint and would like to generate forecasts from the
latent trends. Evaluation involves calculating the Discrete Rank Probability Score and a binary indicator
for whether or not the true value lies within the forecast's 90\% prediction interval
