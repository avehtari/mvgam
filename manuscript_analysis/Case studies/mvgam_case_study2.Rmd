In this example we will examine multivariate forecasting models using `mvgam`, which fits dynamic GAMs (DGAMs) using MCMC sampling (note that either `JAGS` or `Stan` is required; installation links are found [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mcmc-jags/files/) and [here](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan)). First a simulation experiment to determine whether `mvgam`'s inclusion of complexity penalisation works by reducing the number of un-needed dynamic factors. In any factor model, choosing the appropriate number of factors `M` can be difficult. The approach used by `mvgam` when sampling with `JAGS` is to estimate a penalty for each factor that squeezes the factor's variance toward zero, effectively forcing the factor to evolve as a flat white noise process. By allowing each factor's penalty to be estimated in an exponentially increasing manner (following Welty, Leah J., et al. Bayesian distributed lag models: estimating effects of particulate matter air pollution on daily mortality Biometrics 65.1 (2009): 282-291), we hope that we can guard against specifying too large a `M`. Note that when sampling with `Stan`, we capitalise on the superior sampling and exploration of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to choose the number of factors by placing independent normal priors on factor standard deviations. Begin by simulating `6` series that evolve with a shared seasonal pattern and that depend on `2` latent random walk factors. Each series is `100` time steps long, with a seasonal frequency of `12`. We give the trend moderate importance by setting `trend_rel = 0.6` and we allow each series' observation process to be drawn from slightly different Poisson distributions
```{r}
set.seed(1111)
library(mvgam)
dat <- sim_mvgam(T = 100, n_series = 6, n_lv = 2,
                 family = 'poisson',
                 mu_obs = runif(8, 4, 6),
                 trend_rel = 0.6, train_prop = 0.85)
```

Have a look at the series
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
par(mfrow = c(3,2))
for(i in 1:6){
  plot(dat$data_train$y[which(as.numeric(dat$data_train$series) == i)], type = 'l',
       ylab = paste('Series', i), xlab = 'Time', bty = 'L')
  box(bty = 'L', lwd = 2)
}
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
```

Clearly there are some correlations in the trends for these series. But how does a dynamic factor process allow us to potentially capture these dependencies? The below example demonstrates how. Essentially, a dynamic factor is an *unobserved* (latent) random process that induces correlations between time series via a set of factor loadings ($\beta$) while exercising dimension reduction. The loadings represent constant associations between the observed time series and the dynamic factor, but each series can still deviate from the factor through its error process and its associations with other factors (if we estimate `>1` latent factor in our model).

A challenge with any factor model is the need to determine the number of factors `M`. Setting `M` too small prevents temporal dependencies from being adequately modelled, leading to poor convergence and difficulty estimating smooth parameters. By contrast, setting `M` too large leads to unnecessary computation. `mvgam` approaches this problem by formulating a prior distribution that enforces exponentially increasing penalties on the factor variances to allow any un-needed factors to evolve as flat lines. Now let's fit a well-specified model for our simulated series in which we estimate random intercepts, a shared seasonal cyclic smooth and `2` latent dynamic factors
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mod1 <- mvgam(data_train = dat$data_train,
                data_test = dat$data_test,
                formula = y ~ s(series, bs = 're') +
                  s(season, bs = c('cc'), k = 8),
                knots = list(season = c(0.5, 12.5)),
                use_lv = TRUE,
                n_lv = 2,
                family = 'poisson',
                trend_model = 'RW',
                use_stan = TRUE,
                chains = 4,
                burnin = 500)
```

Look at a few plots. The estimated smooth function
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_smooth(object = mod1, series = 1, smooth = 'season')
```

And the true seasonal function in the simulation
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot(dat$global_seasonality[1:12], type = 'l', bty = 'L', ylab = 'True function', xlab = 'season')
```

Check whether each factor was retained using the `plot_mvgam_factors` function. Here, each factor is tested against a null hypothesis of white noise by calculating the sum of the factor's 1st derivatives. A factor that has a larger contribution to the series' latent trends will have a larger sum, both because that factor's absolute magnitudes will be larger (due to the weaker penalty on the factor's precision) and because the factor will move around more. By normalising these estimated first derivative sums, it should be apparent whether some factors have been dropped from the model. Here we see that each factor is contributing to the series' latent trends, and the plots show that neither has been forced to evolve as white noise
```{r}
plot_mvgam_factors(mod1)
```

Now we fit the same model but assume that we no nothing about how many factors to use, so we specify the maximum allowed (the total number of series; `6`). Note that this model is computationally more expensive so it will take longer to fit
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
mod2 <- mvgam(data_train = dat$data_train,
                data_test = dat$data_test,
                formula = y ~ s(series, bs = 're') +
                  s(season, bs = c('cc'), k = 8),
                knots = list(season = c(0.5, 12.5)),
                use_lv = TRUE,
                n_lv = 6,
                family = 'poisson',
                use_stan = TRUE,
                trend_model = 'RW',
                chains = 4,
                burnin = 500)
```

Use the same plots as model 1 to see if this model has also fit the data well
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_smooth(object = mod2, series = 1, smooth = 'season')
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot(dat$global_seasonality[1:12], type = 'l', bty = 'L', ylab = 'True function', xlab = 'season')
```

Examining the factor contributions gives us some insight into whether we set `n_lv` larger than we perhaps needed to (with some of the factors clearly evolving as unconstrained, zero-centred random walks). These contributions can be interpreted similarly to ordination axes when deciding how many latent variables to specify
```{r}
plot_mvgam_factors(mod2)
```

The very weak contributions by some of the factors are a result of the penalisation, which will become more important as the dimensionality of the data grows. Now onto an empirical example. Here we will access monthly search volume data from `Google Trends`, focusing on relative importances of search terms related to tick paralysis in Queensland, Australia
```{r message=FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyr)
if(!require(gtrendsR)){
  install.packages('gtrendsR')
}

terms = c("tick bite",
          "tick paralysis",
          "dog tick", 
          "paralysis tick dog")
trends <- gtrendsR::gtrends(terms, geo = "AU-QLD",
                            time = "all", onlyInterest = T)
```

`Google Trends` modified their algorithm for extracting search volume data in 2012, so we filter the series to only include observations after this point in time
```{r}
trends$interest_over_time %>%
  tidyr::spread(keyword, hits) %>%
  dplyr::select(-geo, -time, -gprop, -category) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(date = lubridate::ymd(date)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(year = lubridate::year(date)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(year > 2012) %>%
  dplyr::select(-year) -> gtest
```

Convert to an `xts` object and then to the required `mvgam` format, holding out the final 10% of observations as the test data
```{r}
series <- xts::xts(x = gtest[,-1], order.by = gtest$date)
trends_data <- series_to_mvgam(series, freq = 12, train_prop = 0.9)
```

Plot the series to see how similar their seasonal shapes are over time
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot(series, legend.loc = 'topleft')
```

Now we will fit an `mvgam` model with shared seasonality and random intercepts per series. Our first attempt will ignore any temporal component in the residuals so that we can identidy which GAM predictor combination gives us the best fit, prior to investigating how to deal with any remaining autocorrelation. We assume a Poisson observation model for the response. Also note that any smooths using the random effects basis (`s(series, bs = "re")` below) are automatically re-parameterised to use the [non-centred parameterisation that is necessary to help avoid common posterior degeneracies in hierarchical models](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/hierarchical_modeling.html). This parameterisation tends to work better for most ecological problems where the data for each group / context are not highly informative, but it is still probably worth investigating whether a centred or even a mix of centred / non-centred will give better computational performance. We suppress the global intercept as it is not needed and will lead to identifiability issues when estimating the series-specific random intercepts
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
trends_mod1 <- mvgam(data_train = trends_data$data_train,
                      data_test = trends_data$data_test,
                      formula = y ~ s(series, bs = 're') + 
                        s(season, k = 8, m = 2, bs = 'cc') - 1,
                      knots = list(season = c(0.5, 12.5)),
                      trend_model = 'None',
                      family = 'poisson',
                      use_stan = TRUE,
                      chains = 4,
                      burnin = 1000)
```

Given that these series could potentially be following a hierarchical seasonality, we will also trial a slghtly more complex model with an extra smoothing term per series that allows its seasonal curve to deviate from the global seasonal smooth. Ignore the warning about repeated smooths, as this is not an issue for estimation.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
trends_mod2 <- mvgam(data_train = trends_data$data_train,
                      data_test = trends_data$data_test,
                      formula = y ~ s(season, k = 8, m = 2, bs = 'cc') +
                        s(season, series, k = 5, bs = 'fs', m = 1),
                      knots = list(season = c(0.5, 12.5)),
                      trend_model = 'None',
                      family = 'poisson',
                      use_stan = TRUE,
                      chains = 4,
                      burnin = 1000)
```

How can we compare these models to ensure we choose one that performs well and provides useful inferences? Beyond posterior retrodictive and predictive checks, we can take advantage of the fact that `mvgam` fits an `mgcv` model to provide all the necessary penalty matrices, as well as to identify good initial values for smoothing parameters. Because we did not modify this model by adding a trend component (the only modification is that we estimated series-specific overdispersion parameters), we can still employ the usual `mgcv` model comparison routines
```{r}
anova(trends_mod1$mgcv_model,
      trends_mod2$mgcv_model, test = 'LRT')
```

```{r}
AIC(trends_mod1$mgcv_model,
      trends_mod2$mgcv_model)
```

```{r}
summary(trends_mod1$mgcv_model)
```

```{r}
summary(trends_mod2$mgcv_model)
```

Model 2 seems to fit better so far, suggesting that hierarchical seasonality gives better performance for these series. But a problem with both of the above models is that their forecast uncertainties will not increase into the future, which is not how time series forecasts should behave. Here we fit Model 2 again but specifying a time series model for the latent trends. We assume the dynamic trends can be represented using latent factors that each follow a RW process, and we will rely on the exponential penalties to help regularise any un-needed factors by setting `n_lv = 4`
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
trends_mod3 <- mvgam(data_train = trends_data$data_train,
                      data_test = trends_data$data_test,
                      formula = y ~ s(season, k = 8, m = 2, bs = 'cc') +
                        s(season, series, k = 5, bs = 'fs', m = 1),
                      knots = list(season = c(0.5, 12.5)),
                      trend_model = 'RW',
                      use_lv = TRUE,
                      n_lv = 4,
                      family = 'poisson',
                      use_stan = TRUE,
                      chains = 4,
                      burnin = 1000)
```


Have a look at the returned `Stan` model file to see how the dynamic factors are incorporated
```{r}
trends_mod3$model_file
```

Inspection of the dynamic factors and their relative contributions indicates that the first factor is by far the most important
```{r}
plot_mvgam_factors(trends_mod3)
```

Model 3 (with the dynamic trend) should provide far superior forecasts than relying only on the estimated smooths. Inspect the model summary
```{r}
summary(trends_mod3)
```

Look at Dunn-Smyth residuals for some series from this preferred model to ensure that our dynamic factor process has captured most of the temporal dependencies in the observations
```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_resids(trends_mod3, series = 1)
```

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_resids(trends_mod3, series = 2)
```

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_resids(trends_mod3, series = 3)
```

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_resids(trends_mod3, series = 4)
```

Perform posterior predictive checks to see if the model is able to simulate data that looks realistic and unbiased by examining simulated kernel densities for posterior predictions (`yhat`) compared to the density of the observations (`y`). This will be particularly useful for examining whether the Negative Binomial observation model is able to produce realistic looking simulations for each individual series.
```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 1, type = 'hist')
```

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 2, type = 'hist')
```

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 3, type = 'hist')
```

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 4, type = 'hist')
```

Look at traceplots for the smoothing parameters (`rho`)
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_trace(object = trends_mod3, param = 'rho')
```

Plot posterior predictive distributions for the training and testing periods for each series
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_fc(object = trends_mod3, series = 1, data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_fc(object = trends_mod3, series = 2, data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_fc(object = trends_mod3, series = 3, data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_fc(object = trends_mod3, series = 4, data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

Plot posterior distributions for the latent trend estimates, again for the training and testing periods
```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_trend(object = trends_mod3, series = 1, data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_trend(object = trends_mod3, series = 2, data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_trend(object = trends_mod3, series = 3, data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
plot_mvgam_trend(object = trends_mod3, series = 4, data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

Given that we fit a model with hierarchical seasonality, the seasonal smooths are able to deviate from one another (though they share the same wiggliness and all deviate from a common 'global' seasonal function). Here we use the `newdata` argument to generate predictions for each of the hierarchical smooth functions (note that the intercept is still included in these plots so they do not center on zero)
```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3, fig.align='center'}
newdat <- data.frame(season = seq(1, 12, length.out = 100),
                     series = levels(trends_data$data_train$series)[1])
  
plot_mvgam_smooth(object = trends_mod3, series = 1, 
                  smooth = 'season',
                  newdata = newdat)
```

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3, fig.align='center'}
newdat <- data.frame(season = seq(1, 12, length.out = 100),
                     series = levels(trends_data$data_train$series)[2])
  
plot_mvgam_smooth(object = trends_mod3, series = 2, 
                  smooth = 'season',
                  newdata = newdat)
```

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3, fig.align='center'}
newdat <- data.frame(season = seq(1, 12, length.out = 100),
                     series = levels(trends_data$data_train$series)[3])
  
plot_mvgam_smooth(object = trends_mod3, series = 3, 
                  smooth = 'season',
                  newdata = newdat)
```

```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 3, fig.align='center'}
newdat <- data.frame(season = seq(1, 12, length.out = 100),
                     series = levels(trends_data$data_train$series)[4])
  
plot_mvgam_smooth(object = trends_mod3, series = 4, 
                  smooth = 'season',
                  newdata = newdat)
```

Plot posterior mean estimates of latent trend correlations. These correlations are more useful than looking at latent factor loadings, for example to inspect ordinations. This is because the orders of the loadings (although constrained for identifiability purposes) can vary from chain to chain
```{r}
correlations <- lv_correlations(object = trends_mod3)
```

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
mean_correlations <- correlations$mean_correlations
mean_correlations[upper.tri(mean_correlations)] <- NA
mean_correlations <- data.frame(mean_correlations)
ggplot(mean_correlations %>%
         tibble::rownames_to_column("series1") %>%
         tidyr::pivot_longer(-c(series1), names_to = "series2", values_to = "Correlation"),
       aes(x = series1, y = series2)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = Correlation)) +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low="darkred", mid="white", high="darkblue",
                       midpoint = 0,
                       breaks = seq(-1,1,length.out = 5),
                       limits = c(-1, 1),
                       name = 'Trend\ncorrelation') + labs(x = '', y = '') + theme_dark() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1))
```

There is certainly some evidence of positive trend correlations for a few of these search terms, which is not surprising given how similar some of them are and how closely linked they should be to interest about tick paralysis in Queensland. Plot some STL decompositions of these series to see if these trends are noticeable in the data
```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=6, fig.height=4, message=FALSE}
plot(stl(ts(as.vector(series$`tick paralysis`), frequency = 12), 'periodic'))
plot(stl(ts(as.vector(series$`paralysis tick dog`), frequency = 12), 'periodic'))
plot(stl(ts(as.vector(series$`dog tick`), frequency = 12), 'periodic'))
plot(stl(ts(as.vector(series$`tick bite`), frequency = 12), 'periodic'))
```

Forecast period posterior predictive checks suggest that the model still has room for improvement: 
```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 1, type = 'hist', data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 1, type = 'mean', data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```


```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 2, type = 'hist', data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 2, type = 'mean', data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```


```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 3, type = 'hist', data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 3, type = 'mean', data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```


```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 4, type = 'hist', data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, fig.align='center'}
ppc(trends_mod3, series = 4, type = 'mean', data_test = trends_data$data_test)
```

Other next steps could involve devising a more goal-specific set of posterior predictive checks (see [this paper by Gelman et al](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2680852?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents) and [relevant works by Betancourt](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html) for examples) and compare out of sample Discrete Rank Probability Scores for this model and other versions for the latent trends (i.e. AR2, AR3, Random Walk)
